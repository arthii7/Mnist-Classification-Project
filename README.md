# Mnist-Classification-Project

Overview:
The MNIST Classification project is a classic machine learning task aimed at developing models to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9), making it a widely used benchmark for evaluating machine learning algorithms' performance in image classification tasks.

Key Features:
Dataset Exploration: Explore the MNIST dataset, understanding its structure and characteristics, including the distribution of classes and the format of input images.
Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the image data, including normalization and resizing, to prepare it for training machine learning models.
Traditional Machine Learning Models: Implement and train traditional machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Random Forests for digit classification.
Deep Learning Models: Develop deep learning models using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MNIST dataset.
